# Code-free Projects
Sometimes simpler is simpler. Here are a few data analysis projects that were done without programming languages.

## **[Hope for Girls and Women- Web Analytics Packet](https://github.com/elisabethdeltoro/code-free-projects/blob/main/Hope%20for%20Girls%20and%20Women%20Analytics%20Packet.pdf)**
As a United Nations Volunteer, I put together a web analytics packet for a charity in Tanzania. In this packet, I collated analytics materials for their website and social media platforms, to provide audience demographic insights, an overview of where successful posts led, and offered my thoughts on where future energies might be most effective.

## Madison Horn for Senate- Primary Election Results Breakdown Pivot Tables
As a Bluebonnet Data Fellow, I contributed to several projects for the Madison Horn campaign in Oklahoma. For this project, the campaign was interested in Republican Primary Election results. I provided simple analysis for a rapid turnaround in these pivot tables.

## Newsletter Lifetime Value Case Study - Excel Sheet
Many businesses utilize paid and unpaid newsletter subscriptions as a way to engage their audience. In this project I sought to explore the limits of what Excel alone could provide in terms of clarity and readability, since it is a program many people outside the data sphere are comfortable in. I compiled the estimated lifetime earning potential of a newsletter audience year over year.
